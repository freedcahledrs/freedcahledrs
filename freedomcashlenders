A person's lacking credit score is no longer just about financial opportunities with payday loan lenders. After doing a brief study, the New York Times has reported that a person's credit score is now a factor in the dating scene. Numbers talk, and for those who are serious about their finances find that their potential partner's score will say a lot about them. No credit check payday loans may be sinking further into the minority for not looking into a person's credit history.

Can you hear the conversation? "How you doing?" may now sound more like, "How's your credit doing?" Where does the conversation go from there? Do you explain your debt in order to get a second date? Do you admit to using short-term loans in order to make impending payments? How much of your personal financial history are you willing to disclose?

The scary part of sharing financial information lies within, "What could happen if the new person in your life had ulterior motives?" Discussing financial matters with someone you barely know is like entering your personal information into a phishing scheme. People will go to major lengths to acquire details.
