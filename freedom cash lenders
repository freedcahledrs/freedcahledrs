First time home buyers often find Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages consumer friendly. If you have payday loan or credit card debt, FHA will not shut the door on an applicant. A person applying for a FHA loan will need to qualify though, but FHA's qualifications are more lenient than banks and other mortgage providers. The government backed mortgages strive to help consumer get into a home of their own. FHA operates from self-generated income, a totally independent cash flow which does not fall upon tax payers. The proceeds paid into the program feeds the services provided to individual promoting community growth.

Credit scores play a large part in obtaining home loans. If you do not have a score above 620, most financial institutions will not take a second look at your application. Mortgage brokers may look the application and some do loan to those with scores under 620, but not too far under. The interest rate for these types of loans is higher than average, making the purchase of the home more expensive over the long-run. Down payments are a typical requirement for those with lower scores.
